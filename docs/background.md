# Introduction { style="page-break-before:always;"}

The main aim was to create the working damage calculator app which will help the League of Legends players to plan a better strategy using the damage output from the app. The app is made mostly for experienced League of Legends players who care deeply about their results. This is why, we have the focus group which consists of only pro players.

For our MVP we decided to include this functionality: Ally and Enemy selections with the level selectors, Ally’s and Enemy’s items selections, Ally’s and Enemy’s stats, abilities with the rank selectors and damage output. Choosing the champion for ally and enemy (it can be done by typing the name or choosing from the drop list), its level (the arrows up and down), its items (any 6 of them) and choosing the ranks of the abilities will show the stats of the champion and the damage output.

The report contains the detailed project planning, the extensive research, the development section and the evaluation with the summary. We stated the problems that we faced and the process of analysis, we justified the technologies and design decisions and also included the proposal for the future updates of the app.
