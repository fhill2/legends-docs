# Introduction { style="page-break-before:always;"}

The main aim was to create the working damage calculator app which will help experienced League of Legends players plan out and theorycraft better item building strategies using the damage output from the app. The app is primarly aimed at experienced League of Legends players who care deeply about their results. This is why, our focus group consists only of highgly experienced players.

For our MVP we decided to implement the following functionalities: Ally and Enemy selections with the level selectors, Ally’s and Enemy’s items selections, Ally’s and Enemy’s stats, abilities with the rank selectors and damage output. Choosing the champion for ally and enemy (it can be done by typing the name or choosing from the drop list), its level (the arrows up and down), its items (any 6 of them) and choosing the ranks of the abilities will show the stats of the champion and the damage output.

The report contains the detailed project planning, the extensive research, the development section and the evaluation with the summary. We stated the problems that we faced and the process of analysis, we justified the technologies and design decisions and also included the proposal for the future updates of the app.
