#### Iterations

The iterations for sections shown in the Gantt Chart defines a period where we received feedback from surveys, market research, or our focus group and developed and refined the feedback into the project.

By including these iteration cycles into the Gantt chart, we could show the project's progression more clearly.

#### Buffers

The Gantt Chart shows buffers that define a period of time after our scheduled work. If we did not finish the work by the buffer end date, the work we planned in the future would have to be adjusted to compensate.

This was important when scheduling the time designated for obtainining responses for our surveys, as our team could only estimate how long it would take for us to gain feedback from them that satisified our needs to improve and iterate on aspects of the project. If we did not gather satisfactory feedback by the buffer end date, we planned to accept the responses as they are, as spending more time gathering responses would affect other deadlines we set in the future.


Most work was completed on schedule in the time alloted in the Gantt Chart. Some tasks ran into the task's alloted buffer zones, and there were only a few times the Gantt chart was adjusted. 

#### Workload

Our team planned for weeks where the project demanded more resources, and noted these periods in the Gantt Chart. These planned work areas ensured all members of our team spent more of our resources at the same time, and managed our team's planned work expectations.

This section of the Gantt chart was adjusted throughout the project's development. 

After our second user feedback iteration, a second high risk area was identified after our surveys / questionnaires ran behind and the Gantt Chart was edited to show this.
