# Approach and Motivations

The main approach that we use is User-Centred Design. We understand the importance of iterative design process and therefore we created the focus group and involved them in each stage of the design process. We did the requirements elicitation by sending the surveys and also got feedback about wireframes designs. We are planning on sending more surveys to our focus group on the subject of colour palette, choosing the better version of our working web app and its usability features.
