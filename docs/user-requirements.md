### MVP Notes / brainstorm

write about is the user going to enter their target stats or not.

The MVP should provide the user a working prototype for 2 - 3 champions.

At the beginning, our target champion should just be a "blank champion" and the user just tweaks the stats for said target (Basically choose target´s HP, Armor and Magic resistance). 

### After MVP

build a script that can look at the dataset and get us the data we need for every champion allowing us to escalate the project to every champion. 

Then, a further improvement would be to let the user pick an actual champion and their items as the target.
