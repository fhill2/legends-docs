# Scope
There are 162 champions in this game but we are going to focus only on 3
of them - Kai'sa, Ezreal and Ahri as they are from the top 10 most
popular champions according to the research. The input that users are
going to put manually is the level of the champion and it is limited
from 1 to 18 (just as in the game). The amount of gold will be
calculated when users choose the items that they want. There is no
limitation to the gold amount in our app. All the items will be
presented in the selection section in icons. There are only 6 slots for
the items as this is a game limitation. The target in the game can be
enemy champions, minions or buildings. In the target section there will
be a blank champion with the following input: health, armour and magic
resistance (these values users are going to put manually). The output is
the damage that each ability can make and is divided in 6 different
blocks: basic attack, innate ability, Q ability, W ability, E ability, R
ability. The level of the champion influences on the ability rank. Q, W
and E abilities has 5 ranks. And R ability has 3 ranks. The calculations
will be done based on the items that users are going to choose, the
level of the champion and the input data of the enemy. For our MVP we
are not going to cover the choice of the enemy champion / minion /
building, enemy champion's level and the items that he has. Our app will
be in English because the vast majority of players are from
English-speaking countries based on the research.
